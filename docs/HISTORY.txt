Changelog
=========

0.3 - Unreleased
----------------

* Added a global settings object, and added hooks to allow modules of
  PMR2 to have their own subforms.
* Added user workspaces - users can have their own folder to add
  their personal workspaces to.
* Added semi-edited note.  Allowed a use case where users can fill in
  fields and then generate output based on what was entered and content
  of the anchor file.
* Added partial exposure id resolution, where a partial id entered can
  resolve to its full id.
* Pushes to workspace now updates the modified date, so RSS feeds based
  on updates to workspaces can be generated.
* Redone the exposure creation form as it gave too much control to the
  user.
* Simplfied redirection from relative links to files in exposures to
  workspace and refactored how this was done.
* Refactored catalog/indexing code.
* Removed nearly all CellML specific code, with the exception of some 
  OpenCell specific workarounds.
* Removed the ExposureFilePage type.
* Removed the stale portlets for the above type.
* Removed nearly all methods from content type objects.

0.2.2 - Released (2010-02-02)
-----------------------------

* Finishing the document view generation step will no longer trigger a
  file download.
* Added in opencell:externalurl rewriting, much like PCEnv as the
  specification states that the URL for an external file is a literal,
  so it cannot take advantage of the xml:base attribute for the
  normalization of URL to kick in.

0.2.1 - Released (2010-01-12)
-----------------------------

* Added missing function in ExposureFolder, now it will not block
  redirection of files that are in the workspace, and can now have
  documentation generated for it
* Removed file existence check in Exposures, such that all URIs that
  do not exist in Plone are redirected to the source workspace
* For Exposures, @@viewgen is renamed to @@docviewgen for consistency.
* Expired state now is coloured red for all users

0.2 - Released (2009-12-21)
---------------------------

With the following changes:

- 0.2rc1

* Rewrote how Exposures are done.  The pages have been made deprecated
  and replaced with Exposure Files, which are wrappers around the files
  that can be referenced by the exposure.  The views are now annotations
  to those files.
* Buildout includes other view specific for CellML (i.e. code generation
  and MathML).
* Documentation can be generated.  Ones currently builtin to PMR2 
  include HTML and reStructuredText.  The buildout includes ones for
  CellML files.
* Support for Mercurial subrepo for embedding workspaces within another.
* Fixed pushing to workspaces that are marked private using PAS
  (Pluggable Authentication System).
* Various UI refinements.

- 0.2rc2

* Document view generation no longer generates empty title and 
  description if it's unknown.
* HTML document view now generates title from head/title.
* Files can also have a seprate source document like exposure root.
* Fixed authentication issue for Mercurial v0.9.5

- 0.2rc3

* Shows the review state of an exposure to normal users by color coding
  them in the workspace changelog listing, and in the exposure views.

- 0.2rc4

* The pmr2 review state is now correctly reindexes all subobject of an
  exposure when its state changes.
* Freshly created workspace will have its empty file list correctly
