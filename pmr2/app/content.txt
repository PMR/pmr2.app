====================
PMR2 Content Classes
====================

------------
Introduction
------------

There are a number of content types that make up the PMR2 application.

  PMR2
    The root container, it contains vital attributes required for the
    operation of the repository.  One such attribute is the repository
    root directory on the file system; only site managers will have
    access to the form that can manipulate this field by default.
    
    This container also contains other containers to group similar PMR2 
    related objects together, and can optionally contain other Plone
    document types for documentation purposes (e.g. an introduction page
    for the repository instance).

  WorkspaceContainer
    Contains workspaces and provides methods that will aid site managers
    to manage the data it contains.

  Workspace
    It encapsulates an instance of a Version Control System (VCS).  
    Currently Mercurial is the only VCS supported; access to the data 
    within is provided by pmr2.mercurial.

  SandboxContainer
    Contains sandboxes and provides methods that will aid site managers
    to manage the data it contains.

  Sandbox
    Identical to Workspace in terms of functions provided, it also
    provides an environment similar to a checkout of a repository (or
    writable clone of one).  Provides methods to manipulate files and
    changesets.

  ExposureContainer
    Contains exposures.

  Exposure
    These can be considered as published models.  They are created from
    a specific revision of a workspace.  Meaningful presentational views
    can be constructed.

  ExposureDocument
    Based on ATDocument.  Provides the safe rendering of documentation
    in HTML format.

Usage
-----

Here we will test out the content type classes and check out the methods
they provide.  Before we start, we need the utility that will store the
settings for PMR2 registered and add the container objects to the portal
root.
::

    >>> from zope.component import getUtility
    >>> from pmr2.app.content import *
    >>> from pmr2.app.settings import IPMR2GlobalSettings
    >>> pmr2_settings = getUtility(IPMR2GlobalSettings)
    >>> pmr2_settings.repo_root = self.tmpdir
    >>> self.portal['workspace'] = WorkspaceContainer()
    >>> self.portal.workspace
    <WorkspaceContainer at /plone/workspace>
    >>> self.portal['sandbox'] = SandboxContainer()
    >>> self.portal.sandbox
    <SandboxContainer at /plone/sandbox>
    >>> self.portal['exposure'] = ExposureContainer()
    >>> self.portal.exposure
    <ExposureContainer at /plone/exposure>

In the workspace object, there is a method that will return a list of
repositories within.  Since the workspace directory does not currently
exist, it will return an exception.
::

    >>> self.portal.workspace.get_repository_list()
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    WorkspaceDirNotExistsError

Now we create the new directory.  The repository list should function 
correctly now.  As there are obviously no workspaces and no related
workspace objects, we get an empty list.
::

    >>> from pmr2.app.tests import utils
    >>> utils.mkreporoot(pmr2_settings.createDir(self.portal))
    >>> self.portal.workspace.get_repository_list()
    []

Time to populate the directory with some VCS instances.  The method now
returns a list that shows the existence of the VCS instances.  However,
the second value returns shows None, which signifies that it has no Zope
object associated with any of them, as they have not been created.
::

    >>> testdirlist = ['test%d' % i for i in xrange(3)]
    >>> workspace_root = pmr2_settings.dirCreatedFor(self.portal.workspace)
    >>> for i in testdirlist:
    ...     utils.mkrepo(workspace_root, i)
    >>> self.portal.workspace.get_repository_list()
    [('test0', None), ('test1', None), ('test2', None)]

Now we create a couple Workspace objects with the same name to associate
the object to the VCS instance in the workspace directory.  The second
value is now True for them.
::

    >>> ws_objs = ['test%d' % i for i in xrange(2)]
    >>> for i in ws_objs:
    ...     self.portal.workspace[i] = Workspace(i)
    >>> self.portal.workspace.get_repository_list()
    [('test0', True), ('test1', True), ('test2', None)]

If we have a workspace object without an associated repository directory
on the file system, a False value will signify an inconsistency.
::

    >>> self.portal.workspace['zzz'] = Workspace('zzz')
    >>> self.portal.workspace.get_repository_list()
    [('test0', True), ('test1', True), ('test2', None), ('zzz', False)]

Wrong object type will also result in a False value for an existing VCS
instance of the same name as the object.  This should never happen in
normal usage, because other object types have to be placed in here
deliberately.
::

    >>> self.portal.workspace['test2'] = Sandbox('test2')
    >>> self.portal.workspace.get_repository_list()
    [('test0', True), ('test1', True), ('test2', False), ('zzz', False)]
