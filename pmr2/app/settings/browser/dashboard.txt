PMR2 Dashboard
==============

Initialize and test that the environment works.
::

    >>> from zope.component import getUtility
    >>> from pmr2.app.settings.interfaces import IPMR2GlobalSettings
    >>> from pmr2.app.settings.browser import view
    >>> from pmr2.testing.base import TestRequest
    >>> 
    >>> getUtility(IPMR2GlobalSettings)
    <pmr2.app.settings.settings.PMR2GlobalSettingsAnnotation object ...>

See that the dashboard page renders.
::

    >>> request = TestRequest()
    >>> dashboard = view.DashboardView(self.portal, request)
    >>> dashboard.__name__ = 'test-dashboard'
    >>> result = dashboard()

See that the redirection is generated properly for the generic view.
::

    >>> request = TestRequest()
    >>> testpage = view.WorkspaceDashboardPage(self.portal, request)
    >>> testpage.getTarget()
    'http://nohost/plone/w/test_user_1_/'
