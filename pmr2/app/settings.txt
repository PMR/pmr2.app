Global Settings
===============

Just to show that the method works
::

    >>> from pmr2.app.settings import IPMR2GlobalSettings
    >>> from zope.component import getUtility
    >>> pmr2_settings = getUtility(IPMR2GlobalSettings)
    >>> pmr2_settings
    <pmr2.app.settings.PMR2GlobalSettingsAnnotation object ...>
    >>> 'pmr2' in pmr2_settings.repo_root
    True

Also that the edit form actually works on the gloabl settings.  Note
how pmr2_settings created from above is not acquired again.
::

    >>> from pmr2.app.browser.settings import PMR2GlobalSettingsEditForm
    >>> from pmr2.app.tests.base import TestRequest
    >>> request = TestRequest(
    ...     form={
    ...         'form.widgets.repo_root': '/tmp',
    ...         'form.buttons.apply': 1,
    ...     })
    >>> f = PMR2GlobalSettingsEditForm(self.folder, request)
    >>> result = f()
    >>> pmr2_settings.repo_root == '/tmp'
    True
