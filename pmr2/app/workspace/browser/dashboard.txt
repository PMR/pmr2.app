Workspace Options for Dashboard
===============================

Use the test browser to open the dashboard view.  The options specific
to workspaces should have been made introduced::

    >>> tb = self.testbrowser
    >>> tb.open(self.portal.absolute_url() + '/pmr2-dashboard')
    >>> tb.getLink('List personal workspaces').url
    'http://nohost/plone/pmr2-dashboard/workspace-home'
    >>> tb.getLink('Create personal workspace').url
    'http://nohost/plone/pmr2-dashboard/workspace-add'

The dashboard actions depend on the settings defined.  If the user
workspace is enabled, as it is set by default in the test harness,
triggering the link will lead to the url within the user's workspace
container::

    >>> tb.getLink('Create personal workspace').click()
    >>> tb.url
    'http://nohost/plone/w/test_user_1_/+/addWorkspace'

However, if that setting is disabled, the global container will be used
instead::

    >>> import zope.component
    >>> from pmr2.app.settings.interfaces import IPMR2GlobalSettings
    >>> settings = zope.component.getUtility(IPMR2GlobalSettings)
    >>> settings.create_user_workspace = False
    >>> tb.open(self.portal.absolute_url() + '/pmr2-dashboard')
    >>> tb.getLink('Create personal workspace').click()
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    HTTPError: HTTP Error 404: Not Found

Well then, if the container wasn't available a 404 error was raised as
expected.  Now try this again with the workspace container in place.

    >>> from pmr2.app.workspace.content import WorkspaceContainer
    >>> self.portal['workspace'] = WorkspaceContainer()
    >>> tb.open(self.portal.absolute_url() + '/pmr2-dashboard')
    >>> tb.getLink('Create personal workspace').click()
    >>> tb.url
    'http://nohost/plone/workspace/+/addWorkspace'
