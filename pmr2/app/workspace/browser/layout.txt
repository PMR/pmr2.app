================
Workspace Layout
================

Since we can't present our forms and views directly because we make use
of the wrapper class, we need to make one that is compatible with the
inner views that is being used in the case where protocol level access
is needed thus all the other template chrome should not be rendered.

We just do a quick and simple test where we just import the final 
wrapped viewer class in the browser module that make use of the wrapper.
::

    >>> from pmr2.app.workspace.browser import browser
    >>> from pmr2.testing.base import TestRequest
    >>> from plone.z3cform.tests import setup_defaults
    >>> from pmr2.app.workspace.content import *
    >>> self.portal['workspace'] = WorkspaceContainer()
    >>> self.portal.workspace['cake'] = Workspace('cake')
    >>> self.portal.workspace.cake.storage = u'dummy_storage'
    >>> context = self.portal.workspace.cake
    >>> request = TestRequest(form={'cmd': 'revcount'})
    >>> view = browser.WorkspacePageView(context, request)
    >>> print view()
    2

If there are no custom request, the whole thing will be rendered, but
we don't have the full request object hence we won't be testing that
here.
