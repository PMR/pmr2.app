=======================
Workspace root indexing
=======================

To facilitate the listing of related workspaces, the underlying storage
would need to provide unique content identifiers for each of the changes
that it tracks.  This feature targets compatible version control systems
that underlay the relevant storage implementation.

Attempt to index a workspace to see that the root commit identifiers are
returned.
::

    >>> from pmr2.app.workspace.catalog import pmr2_workspace_storage_roots
    >>> pmr2_workspace_storage_roots(self.portal.workspace.test)()
    ['0']

Should not throw an exception if an incompatible object was passed::

    >>> pmr2_workspace_storage_roots(object)()
    []

Also should not throw an exception if somehow the adapted storage
object does not implement the required methods::

    >>> from pmr2.app.workspace.storage import BaseStorage
    >>> storage = BaseStorage('dummy')
    >>> pmr2_workspace_storage_roots(storage)()
    []
