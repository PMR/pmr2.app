Exposure Creation Wizard
========================

In an effort to streamline the exposure creation process, a wizard that
unifies the disparate forms (documentation, file type, annotations, 
rollover) into a unified form that can serve as the base form for users
to interact with.  This is based on the rollover interface and data
structure used in the rollover interface.  There are a few components,
which includes an annotation object on the exposure object containing a
work-in-progress exposure structure, the json export version of this 
item to allow more dynamic user experience, along with the javascript
interactive controls that interface with the underlying form.  The
structure would also need to be reused later if necessary, allowing the
user to regenerate the form or load a new exposure structure from the
objects created through other means.

To demonstrate, we initialize the set of imports.
::

    >>> import zope.interface
    >>> import zope.component
    >>> from Products.CMFCore.utils import getToolByName
    >>> from plone.z3cform.tests import setup_defaults
    >>> from pmr2.testing.base import TestRequest
    >>> from pmr2.app.exposure.browser import browser as exposure
    >>> from pmr2.app.workspace import browser as workspace
    >>> from pmr2.app.interfaces import *
    >>> from pmr2.app.workspace.content import *
    >>> from pmr2.app.workspace.interfaces import *
    >>> from pmr2.app.exposure.content import *
    >>> from pmr2.app.exposure.interfaces import *

    >>> from pmr2.app.exposure.browser import wizard

We acquire an exposure object that's already been created.
::

    >>> context = self.portal.exposure['1']
    >>> context
    <Exposure at /plone/exposure/1>

Then adapt that into an exposure wizard, which provides some helper
methods and the place to store a work-in-progress exposure structure.
::

    >>> ewiz = zope.component.getAdapter(context, IExposureWizard)
    >>> IExposureWizard.providedBy(ewiz)
    True

Render the wizard:
::

    >>> request = TestRequest()
    >>> context = self.portal.exposure['1']
    >>> form = wizard.ExposureWizardForm(context, request)
    >>> result = form()
    >>> 'export_uri' in result
    True
