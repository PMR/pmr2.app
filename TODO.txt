The original Sandbox plan was to implement these functionalities.

- Provides http upload function
- Provides metadata editor and other editing capabilities
* push and pull, much like workspace

However, there are talks to rethink this idea.

v0.2 wishlist
=============

General:
--------

- better workflow for managing exposures (mostly for deprecation)
  - also single-click workflow change for all subobjects
  - (?)
- private, use/time limited links to open model?
- complete implementation of custom search object to fit better into
  the look-and-feel of the default views.


Curation Manifest:
------------------

At the core, it is just a file (probably RDF based) that lists the
checksums (both MD5 and SHA1) of the curated files, and the curation
"flags" assigned to this model.  

This file could be extended to include the titles for the objects that
will be created by PMR2, i.e. rules to create the exposure.

A user then can have an offline copy of the curation information, and
when s/he goes online can verify the contents of their copy against the
one stored in PMR2.  They can calculate the link, possibly something
like:

http://models.cellml.org/verify/sha1/[sha1 of their manifest file].

If an exposure was created using that manifest file, it will return the
file, giving a list of all checksums which should match the checksums in
the file the user has.

The goal of this file is to enable one-click exposure creation as the
settings used to generate the exposure pages can be saved to such a 
file.

A modeler can choose to create an exposure based on this curation file
if it supports exposure type (for each file(s) s/he wishes to create an
exposure page for), title(s) of the resulting object(s), and other
presentation related fields.

Here is a sample, work in progress.  The namespace URI defined for this
will be changed if and when we standardize and make this generic enough
for the usage of all model types.

A few notes:

    - We are using a "temporary" namespace URI to identify the manifest:
      http://www.cellml.org/tools/pmr2/
    - The node with rdf:about="" is the root container for all the
      subobjects defined.
    - Each manifest within a node can only define paths within its own
      directory.  Note how imports directory has a separate definition

      - Manifest must be in a Seq so order can be defined for the
        navigational elements of PMR2.

    - Each entry should have a title and description, or one will be
      generated by PMR2.

      - One can also reference another snippet of RDF within another
        RDF file through this::
        
            <dc:title rdf:resource="main.cellml#title">

        Which the main.cellml will be parsed for RDF content, and the
        literal with the id 'title' will be used.

    - The folder type objects (Exposure, Folder) will need to define
      a defaultpage, or a bare minimum index page is generated.
    - Curation at the root object applies to every single files under
      it, but each files can override it using pmr2:curation_remove or
      pmr2:curation_insert.  Or perhaps even override by redefining the
      tag.  [XXX: this will need much further discussion]
    - Curation is defined using URN, to aid in future migration towards
      using standardized curation ontologies.
    - Checksums are to aid curators in determining whether the contents
      of the curated files have changed since the last time the flags
      were put into place.
    
      - Checksums were put into place as a crutch for "offline" 
        verification of the curated model content.  Providing a revision
        identifier might probably do the trick, since it will contain
        the real checksums of the files the user want to check against,
        and this may be somewhat simpler.

    - This file is only "recipe" to create the final, curated exposure
      pages for use within PMR2.  All curation values, checksums, and
      other information exists for convenience and are not authoritative
      in determining the validity of the curation flags against the
      content.  While the checksums and the like can be checked against
      this manifest, users will still need to verify that this manifest
      file was used to create an exposure that has been validated by a
      curator.

Exposure Workflow
-----------------

Exposures should really only have one single workflow state for the
entire container to simplify control.  Also, curation flags should apply
to each file, not the entire container.


Exposure Type
-------------

We need our expousures to look better, include related models, other
curation status flags.


Metadata Editing:
-----------------

PMR1 had an online metadata editing.  This was originally slated to be
part of the Sandbox, but if we ditch the sandbox there will be no way
to safely edit metadata online.  However, we can still have an offline
metadata editor, and it should be able to present and allow editing of
any arbitrary metadata.  It should also save metadata back to where it
was originally found in the XML document.

This RDF metadata could also be used to edit the curation manifest file.


Listing of models:
------------------

More versatile index page that can do listing by alphabetical order and
the like.


Workspace Exposure Listing:
---------------------------

Clean up that listing so a user can see what has been exposed at a
glance, and in chronological order if possible.  For performance needs
the commit id along with its dates will need to be indexed.


Searching/Catalog:
------------------

ZCatalog is legacy, not versatile and pollutes objects with unneeded
methods.  See if we can integrate the newer catalogs.
