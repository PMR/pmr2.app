There will need to be these objects.

Root object

Workspace containers
Workspaces, i.e. Mercurial

Sandbox containers
Sandbox, allows editing

Exposure container
Exposures

Root object
- admin editing only
- points to paths on filesystem

Workspace container
- Lists workspaces
- List specific workspace for authors. (your workspaces?)
- Allows searching?
- Create workspace
  - Site admin only
  - Instantiate an existing Hg instance for inclusion into repository

Workspace
- Provides read-only access
- Provides write access via hg push
- Option to let owner pull from specific sandbox
  - list push requests from sandboxes?

* workflow states
  - allowing push?

Sandbox container
- Lists sandboxes explicit to the user

* workflow states
  - private
  - accepting new project

Sandbox
- Provides uploading facilities
- Provides metadata editor and other editing capabilities
* push and pull, much like workspace

Exposure container
- Lists exposures
- Search exposures

Exposures
- Provides curation facilities
- Provides various views, such as citation, metadata and graphing.

Search Objects
- Provides adminstrators (and curators?) the option to create custom
searches based on the URI trailing the search object.  Search objects
would have an id (e.g. ./biotype) which would form the base URI for the
search (http://example.org/models/biotype/), and then the search term
will be after that, such that we get URIs that could look like:

http://example.org/models/biotype/cell_cycle
http://example.org/models/biotype/cardiac_cell

They would return a listing of models that have biotype of cell_cycle
and cardiac_cell, respectively (assuming biotype searches in the 
'biotype' index).

Model exposure front page
- It would contain all the data of all the objects within so it can be indexed.
