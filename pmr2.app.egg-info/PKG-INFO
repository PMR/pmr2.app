        Changelog
        =========
        
        0.3.2 - Unreleased
        ------------------
        
        * Fresh installation now works as intended on standard configurations as
        the bugs that prevented this were fixed.
        - Default installation now correctly allow Mercurial clients to prompt
        users for authentication.
        - https://tracker.physiomeproject.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2625
        
        - PMR2 no longer prevents a default Plone site from rendering if it is
        present but not installed using the portal add-on installer tool.
        - https://tracker.physiomeproject.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2626
        
        0.3.1 - Released (2010-06-22)
        -----------------------------
        
        * Fixed bugs that manifested in a virtual host environment.
        - exposure creation (both normal and rollover).
        - listing of exposures in the workspace pages.
        
        * Removed placeholder subrepo list bullets.
        
        0.3 - Released (2010-06-21)
        ---------------------------
        
        * Streamlined exposure creation process.
        - Added a exposure file type definition object, which allows
        repository managers to define a profile for different files, such
        that users can use it to generate consistent view listings with
        the correct tags (subject) attached to the file.
        - This also allows users to fill in all the data for all the views in
        a single form, rather than loading forms for every view they want to
        assign to the file if the file type is not defined for the file they
        want to create an exposure of.
        
        * Added a global settings object, and added hooks to allow modules of
        PMR2 to have their own subforms.
        * Added user workspaces - users can have their own folder to add
        their personal workspaces to.
        * Added semi-edited note.  Enabled the use case where users can fill in
        fields and then generate output based on what was entered and content
        of the anchor file.
        * Added partial exposure id resolution, where a partial id entered will
        resolve to its full id and redirect to the complete link.
        * Pushes to workspace now updates the modified date, so RSS feeds based
        on updates to workspaces can be generated.
        * Redone the exposure creation form as it was insecure against errors.
        * Simplfied redirection from relative links to files in exposures to
        workspace and refactored how this was done.
        * Fixed the 'Views available' link to show the default view rather than
        downloading the file.
        * Refactored catalog/indexing code.
        * Removed nearly all CellML specific features.
        * Removed the ExposureFilePage type (deprecated in v0.2).
        * Removed the stale portlets for the above type.
        * Removed nearly all methods from content type objects, mostly have to
        do with the usage of the index/catalog adapters.
        
        0.2.2 - Released (2010-02-02)
        -----------------------------
        
        * Finishing the document view generation step will no longer trigger a
        file download.
        * Added in opencell:externalurl rewriting, much like PCEnv as the
        specification states that the URL for an external file is a literal,
        so it cannot take advantage of the xml:base attribute for the
        normalization of URL to kick in.
        
        0.2.1 - Released (2010-01-12)
        -----------------------------
        
        * Added missing function in ExposureFolder, now it will not block
        redirection of files that are in the workspace, and can now have
        documentation generated for it
        * Removed file existence check in Exposures, such that all URIs that
        do not exist in Plone are redirected to the source workspace
        * For Exposures, @@viewgen is renamed to @@docviewgen for consistency.
        * Expired state now is coloured red for all users
        
        0.2 - Released (2009-12-21)
        ---------------------------
        
        With the following changes:
        
        - 0.2rc1
        
        * Rewrote how Exposures are done.  The pages have been made deprecated
        and replaced with Exposure Files, which are wrappers around the files
        that can be referenced by the exposure.  The views are now annotations
        to those files.
        * Buildout includes other view specific for CellML (i.e. code generation
        and MathML).
        * Documentation can be generated.  Ones currently builtin to PMR2
        include HTML and reStructuredText.  The buildout includes ones for
        CellML files.
        * Support for Mercurial subrepo for embedding workspaces within another.
        * Fixed pushing to workspaces that are marked private using PAS
        (Pluggable Authentication System).
        * Various UI refinements.
        
        - 0.2rc2
        
        * Document view generation no longer generates empty title and
        description if it's unknown.
        * HTML document view now generates title from head/title.
        * Files can also have a seprate source document like exposure root.
        * Fixed authentication issue for Mercurial v0.9.5
        
        - 0.2rc3
        
        * Shows the review state of an exposure to normal users by color coding
        them in the workspace changelog listing, and in the exposure views.
        
        - 0.2rc4
        
        * The pmr2 review state is now correctly reindexes all subobject of an
        exposure when its state changes.
        * Freshly created workspace will have its empty file list correctly
        rendered.
        
        - 0.2rc5
        
        * Allow the editing/rearrangement of views in ExposureFile
        * Documentation pages within an exposure can now reference files in
        embedded workspaces.
        
        0.1.2 - Released (2009-07-23)
        -----------------------------
        
        * Made empty workspace not result in an error page.
        
        0.1.1 - Released (2009-07-16)
        -----------------------------
        
        * Session label should mention OpenCell to avoid confusion.
        * Fixed a minor rendering issue with MathML on empty models.
        * Fixed keyword string generation.
        * Made citation author list sort case agnostic.
        
        0.1 - Released (2009-06-22)
        ---------------------------
        
        * Initial release of the Physiome Model Repository 2.  This provides
        integration with Mercurial using the API through a wrapper module.
        * Workspaces are objects that wrap around a Mercurial repository.
        * Exposures are folder objects that references a specific changeset of
        a specific workspace.
        * Exposure pages are pages that represent some files, and are grouped
        together by metapages.
        * For detailed changes from initial development to this release, please
        consult the logs in the version control system.
