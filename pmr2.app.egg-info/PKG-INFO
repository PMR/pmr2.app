        ============
        
        
        
        Changelog
        =========
        
        0.2.1 - Released (2010-01-12)
        -----------------------------
        
        * Added missing function in ExposureFolder, now it will not block
        redirection of files that are in the workspace, and can now have
        documentation generated for it
        * Removed file existence check in Exposures, such that all URIs that
        do not exist in Plone are redirected to the source workspace
        * For Exposures, @@viewgen is renamed to @@docviewgen for consistency.
        * Expired state now is coloured red for all users
        
        0.2 - Released (2009-12-21)
        ---------------------------
        
        With the following changes:
        
        0.2rc1
        * Rewrote how Exposures are done.  The pages have been made deprecated
        and replaced with Exposure Files, which are wrappers around the files
        that can be referenced by the exposure.  The views are now annotations
        to those files.
        * Buildout includes other view specific for CellML (i.e. code generation
        and MathML).
        * Documentation can be generated.  Ones currently builtin to PMR2
        include HTML and reStructuredText.  The buildout includes ones for
        CellML files.
        * Support for Mercurial subrepo for embedding workspaces within another.
        * Fixed pushing to workspaces that are marked private using PAS
        (Pluggable Authentication System).
        * Various UI refinements.
        
        0.2rc2
        * Document view generation no longer generates empty title and
        description if it's unknown.
        * HTML document view now generates title from head/title.
        * Files can also have a seprate source document like exposure root.
        * Fixed authentication issue for Mercurial v0.9.5
        
        0.2rc3
        * Shows the review state of an exposure to normal users by color coding
        them in the workspace changelog listing, and in the exposure views.
        
        0.2rc4
        * The pmr2 review state is now correctly reindexes all subobject of an
        exposure when its state changes.
        * Freshly created workspace will have its empty file list correctly
        rendered.
        
        0.2rc5
        * Allow the editing/rearrangement of views in ExposureFile
        * Documentation pages within an exposure can now reference files in
        embedded workspaces.
        
        0.1.2 - Released (2009-07-23)
        -----------------------------
        
        * Made empty workspace not result in an error page.
        
        0.1.1 - Released (2009-07-16)
        -----------------------------
        
        * Session label should mention OpenCell to avoid confusion.
        * Fixed a minor rendering issue with MathML on empty models.
        * Fixed keyword string generation.
        * Made citation author list sort case agnostic.
        
        0.1 - Released (2009-06-22)
        ---------------------------
        
        * Initial release of the Physiome Model Repository 2.  This provides
        integration with Mercurial using the API through a wrapper module.
        * Workspaces are objects that wrap around a Mercurial repository.
        * Exposures are folder objects that references a specific changeset of
        a specific workspace.
        * Exposure pages are pages that represent some files, and are grouped
        together by metapages.
        * For detailed changes from initial development to this release, please
        consult the logs in the version control system.
